## üß† Code Highlights
Key logic used in **Tap Master Pro**:

### Ball Spawning Mechanism:
```javascript
function spawnBall(type) {
    let ball = document.createElement('div');
    ball.classList.add('ball', type);
    ball.style.left = `${Math.random() * 90}%`;
    ball.style.top = `${Math.random() * 90}%`;
    ball.onclick = () => handleBallClick(type);
    document.getElementById('playArea').appendChild(ball);
}
```

### Score Calculation:
```javascript
function updateScore(ballType) {
    switch (ballType) {
        case 'normal': score += 1; break;
        case 'timeBonus': time += 5; break;
        case 'timePenalty': time -= 3; break;
        case 'danger': gameOver(); break;
    }
    document.getElementById('score').innerText = score;
}
```

### Game Over Handling:
```javascript
function gameOver() {
    alert('Game Over! Final Score: ' + score);
    location.reload();
}
```

These logic snippets highlight how the game mechanics are handled programmatically.
